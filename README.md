# Itinerant

![Microverse](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Microverse-6F23FF?style=for-the-badge)

Itinerant is a web App that allows user to keep the record of all his travel logs.

It can be used by any organisations who wants their employee to keep track of all their travels in order to provide Travel Allowances (TA).
An employee can group his travel in different categories and also create a custom category to categorize his travel record.

It's extremely easy for an organisation to monitor all the travel records of their employees on daily basis and estimate the allowances and analyse on 
different basis e.g. department wise, month wise or the travel made by using private or public transportation.
